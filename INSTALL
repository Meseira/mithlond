Installation
============

To install Mithlond in Debian Jessie, simply run the script called `install` as system administrator. This script copies files in appropriate folders, enable the Systemd service for Mithlond and set a basic configuration file with no user.

You can now add the users to Mithlond's user list with the help of the command `mithlond subscribe USER` and reboot to take into consideration all the changes.
